# NatuReddit
Personal project aimed at developing a ML service which resembles a production environment system, from data collection, to data organization, model developement to finally deployement.

This focus of this project is not on the model (it's going to just be a text/image classification) but moreso on MLops.

## The project

The current idea is to develop a service which is able to tell whether a reddit post is of fauna, flora or landscape.  
Once that is done we can further classify it into subclasses (animal type, flora type)

### Technologies

I plan to use the services provided by AWS.
